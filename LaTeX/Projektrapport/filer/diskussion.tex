\section{Resonator}
Any air leaks between the two parts could cause variability inthe resonant frequency, thus the chamber and bottom were O-ringed to have them sealed. There is a salverfixed on the bottom so that the watermelon could not move when going up. All parts were made of clearstainless steel to reduce varying of temperature on the volume of the chamber and the noise around.
